These units, known as Qubic Units (QUs), serve as the fuel for executing smart contracts and accessing other services on the Qubic platform. Unlike traditional monetary units, QUs are burned when used, which is a fundamental concept in understanding the unique tokenomics of Qubic.</p><h2 id="qubic-units-qus" tabindex="-1">Qubic Units (QUs) <a class="header-anchor" href="#qubic-units-qus" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Qubic Units (QUs)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>QUs act as a measurement of computational &#39;energy&#39; spent on the Qubic platform. Whether it&#39;s running smart contracts or seeking data from oracles, the consumption of QUs is the bedrock of transactions within the system. It&#39;s vital to note that QUs, while having a value, are not &#39;paid&#39; to the system entities Computors. Instead, they are &#39;burned&#39; or permanently removed from circulation, contributing to a balance between inflation and deflation in the Qubic economy.</p><ul><li>QUs are burned when used, contributing to a balance between inflation and deflation.</li><li>Circulating supply: 100T (10% of max supply)</li><li>Max supply: 1000T</li><li>Weekly emission: 1T</li><li>Burned supply: 11T (and growing)</li><li>Every smart contract creation and execution burns Qubic.</li><li>Potential for deflation to exceed inflation.</li></ul><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The Qubic network utilizes $QUBIC (an not $QU) as its official financial ticker.</p></div><h2 id="epoch-and-qu-generation" tabindex="-1">Epoch and QU Generation <a class="header-anchor" href="#epoch-and-qu-generation" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Epoch and QU Generation&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Each epoch in the Qubic network spans seven days and produces 1 trillion QUs. These units are predominantly allocated to Computors, the backbone nodes of the network. In scenarios of maximum efficiency, a Computor can potentially receive a revenue equivalent to 1 trillion QUs divided by 676 (i.e. 1.479 billion QUs). The distribution model is designed to encourage efficiency; Computors operating at suboptimal levels will witness a dip in their revenue. The remaining balance of QUs is assigned to the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator plays no role in smart contract governance, voting or QU distribution, ensuring equilibrium within the Qubic economic framework.</p><p>Regarding the overall supply, it isn&#39;t indefinite. The circulating coins are capped at 1000 trillion, excluding emission coins. A point will come in the future — no earlier than 2041 — where the burn rate will match or surpass the emission rate, causing a plateau in the circulating coins&#39; growth. Nevertheless, miners are assured of their rewards in perpetuity. This guarantee stems from built-in economic drivers. Hypothetically, should Qubic ever approach having 999 trillion QUs in circulation, the quorum would initiate a weekly burn of 1 trillion QUs as execution fees, ensuring consistent revenue generation.</p><h2 id="transfers-and-fees" tabindex="-1">Transfers and Fees <a class="header-anchor" href="#transfers-and-fees" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Transfers and Fees&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Qubic stands apart from traditional systems with its approach to transfers and fees. Transfers within the Qubic network are <strong>feeless</strong>, contributing to the efficiency and user-friendly nature of the platform. Furthermore, &#39;fees&#39; associated with executing smart contracts are not fees in the traditional sense. These QUs are burned and not given to Computors, further reinforcing the concept of QUs as &#39;energy&#39; rather than money.</p><h2 id="what-is-the-burn-mechanism-for-qubic" tabindex="-1">What is the burn mechanism for $QUBIC? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-the-burn-mechanism-for-qubic" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is the burn mechanism for $QUBIC?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Currently, there are 2 burn mechanisms:</p><ul><li><p>By initiating Smart contracts through an Initial Public Offering (IPO), where the costs for shares are burned.</p></li><li><p>By executing Smart Contracts.</p></li></ul><p>Later, 2 other mechanisms will be added:</p><ul><li><p>Having Oracles burn $QUBIC while providing the Qubic chain with real world data.</p></li><li><p>The usage of Aigarth.</p></li></ul><p>_</p><p>In essence, QUs serve as the lifeblood of the Qubic network, driving its operations, incentivizing efficiency, and maintaining a balance in the tokenomics through a system of rewards and burns. The unique role of QUs within the network design underlines the adaptive, efficient, and democratic nature of the Qubic platform.</p>',18),r=[o];function s(c,l,u,h,d,m){return t(),i("div",null,r)}const b=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
