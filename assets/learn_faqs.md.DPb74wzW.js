Qubic devs are working on interoperability solutions that will allow standard industry wallets to support Qubic in the future. Whether they implement Qubic for their wallet will be up to each wallet vendor.</p><h2 id="where-can-i-monitor-the-emissions-for-qubic" tabindex="-1">Where can i monitor the emissions for $QUBIC? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-can-i-monitor-the-emissions-for-qubic" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where can i monitor the emissions for $QUBIC?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The emission is 1.000 billion $QUBIC per week long epoch split between all 676 Computors (Validators) based on their network performance.</p><p>you can see the performance and potential revenue of every Computor in the current epoch in real time.</p><h2 id="where-to-check-the-current-total-supply-of-qubic" tabindex="-1">Where to check the current total supply of $QUBIC? <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-check-the-current-total-supply-of-qubic" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to check the current total supply of $QUBIC?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You can check the current $QUBIC supply on our <a href="https://app.qubic.li/network/explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">block explorer</a>.</p><h2 id="why-cpu-mining" tabindex="-1">Why cpu mining? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-cpu-mining" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why cpu mining?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In this case, it has been found that mining on the CPU is more effective.
