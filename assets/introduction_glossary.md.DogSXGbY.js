Its primary function is to run a special algorithm that allows for the evolution of solutions based on Helix logic gates. This process is transparent, with progress points available to all participants, promoting a collective push towards efficient solutions.</p><h2 id="arbitrator" tabindex="-1">Arbitrator <a class="header-anchor" href="#arbitrator" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Arbitrator&quot;">​</a></h2><p>An entity within the Qubic ecosystem responsible for resolving disputes and protecting user interests. The Arbitrator sets parameters of the mining algorithm, publishes lists of computors every epoch, is developing the capacity to replace faulty computors, and accumulates QUs not received by underperforming computors. Each node operator individually selects their arbitrator by setting the corresponding ID in Qubic.cpp.</p><h2 id="candidate" tabindex="-1">Candidate <a class="header-anchor" href="#candidate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Candidate&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A Candidate is a node that runs the Computors software but hasn&#39;t yet achieved the status of a Computor. In each epoch, up to 256 candidates can ascend to Computor status if they rank among the top 676 nodes based on their score. It&#39;s important to note that only Computors with a full week&#39;s status receive Qubic Units (QUs) as rewards for their performance. While Candidates don&#39;t earn any QUs, running as a Candidate is essential for pushing solutions to the blockchain, which is a prerequisite for becoming a Computor.</p><h2 id="computor" tabindex="-1">Computor <a class="header-anchor" href="#computor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Computor&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Computors refer to the machines or nodes that participate in the network&#39;s consensus protocol and perform computation tasks. They are a critical component of the Qubic network, responsible for executing transactions on the Spectrum and running smart contracts.</p><h2 id="computor-controlled-fund-ccf" tabindex="-1">Computor Controlled Fund (CCF) <a class="header-anchor" href="#computor-controlled-fund-ccf" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Computor Controlled Fund (CCF)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Computor Controlled Fund is a community-driven funding mechanism designed to support the development and growth of the Qubic ecosystem. It is used to finance approved projects that contribute to expanding the capabilities, reach or efficiency of the Qubic network. Projects are proposed by community members and selected through a voting process. The CCF enables the quick definition of project packages and efficient allocation of budgets. The aim of the CCF is to empower the community to collaboratively decide on and prioritize the network&#39;s development directions.</p><p>Key aspects of the CCF include:</p><ul><li><strong>Project proposals:</strong> Any member of the community can submit a project proposal that aims to improve or extend the Qubic ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Community voting:</strong> Projects are selected and funded based on community votes, ensuring that funding goes to projects with broad support and alignment with community interests.</li><li><strong>Rapid implementation:</strong> Once approved, funding enables rapid implementation of proposals, accelerating innovation and ecosystem adaptation.</li></ul><h2 id="energy" tabindex="-1">Energy <a class="header-anchor" href="#energy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Energy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The amount of QUs per identity on the Spectrum (similar to &quot;balance&quot;).</p><h2 id="epoch" tabindex="-1">Epoch <a class="header-anchor" href="#epoch" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Epoch&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A one-week time period from Wednesday 12 UTC to Wednesday 12 UTC during which 1 trillion QUs are generated.</p><h2 id="identity" tabindex="-1">Identity <a class="header-anchor" href="#identity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Identity&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Qubic&#39;s wallet address, also serves as the identity ID for the calculator.</p><p>Miners in Qubic play a crucial role in supporting calculators. Miners receive problems or tasks from calculators. When miners find solutions to these tasks based on the given address ID, they return results back to the calculators. This continuous exchange between tasks and solutions within an epoch determines each calculator&#39;s score for that period. High scores are crucial for calculators aiming to stay in the top 676 positions.</p><h2 id="oracles" tabindex="-1">Oracles <a class="header-anchor" href="#oracles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Oracles&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A feature in development for Qubic. In blockchain technology, oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information, enabling them to interact with the outside world.</p><h2 id="qus" tabindex="-1">QUs <a class="header-anchor" href="#qus" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;QUs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>QUs or Qubic Units is the native coin and positioned as equivalent of &quot;energy&quot; units spent to run smart-contract and access other services in Qubic (e.g. donations to oracles). Yes, QUs can be used as money, but they are more than that. Transfers are feeless and notion of &quot;fee&quot; for smart contracts doesn&#39;t make much sense, because qus are destroyed, not given to computors. When one asks an oracle he &quot;burns&quot; QUs as a sacrifice, not as a payment, it&#39;s not even guaranteed that the oracle will answer.</p><h2 id="quorum" tabindex="-1">Quorum <a class="header-anchor" href="#quorum" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quorum&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A quorum is the minimum number of computors necessary to conduct any sort of business. In Qubic the Quorum is 2/3 (or 451) of all Computors to reach consensus.</p><h2 id="quottery" tabindex="-1">Quottery <a class="header-anchor" href="#quottery" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Quottery&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Quottery is one of Qubic&#39;s first smart contracts, enabling decentralized betting with a transparent payout structure:</p><ul><li>10% goes to a computer-controlled fund.</li><li>20% goes to shareholders as dividends.</li><li>70% goes to the winner(s) of the bet.</li></ul><p>This also marks the first implementation of Oracles on the Qubic network.</p><h2 id="qx" tabindex="-1">Qx <a class="header-anchor" href="#qx" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Qx&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Qx is the first decentralized exchange within the Qubic ecosystem, initiated through an IPO of 676 shares to the community at epoch 65. Qx holders receive passive income from trading fees, leveraging the network&#39;s speed of 40M transfers per second to offer unique opportunities.</p><h2 id="smart-contracts" tabindex="-1">Smart Contracts <a class="header-anchor" href="#smart-contracts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Smart Contracts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Qubic&#39;s first smart contract was an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 676 shares for a decentralized exchange (DEX) named Qx.</p><h2 id="spectrum" tabindex="-1">Spectrum <a class="header-anchor" href="#spectrum" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Spectrum&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Spectrum, as the clear and unalterable ledger within the Qubic network, maintains a comprehensive log of transactions executed in the network per epoch. With decentralized nodes managing its consensus, the Spectrum underscores its transparency, security, and decentralization. These characteristics solidify it as a core component of the Qubic network, fostering trust and transparency for users across the globe.</p><h2 id="steering-committee-steco" tabindex="-1"><strong>Steering Committee</strong> (SteCo) <a class="header-anchor" href="#steering-committee-steco" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Steering Committee** (SteCo)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>SteCo is the governance body of Qubic, elected by the “quorum” to ensure network security and streamline activities that drive Qubic’s growth. Our mission is to pioneer advancements in the blockchain and AI domains.</p><h2 id="ticks" tabindex="-1">Ticks <a class="header-anchor" href="#ticks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Ticks&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the Qubic ecosystem, the tick is the interval within which the Quorum commes to an agreement on transactions and the outcome computed smart contracts. A single tick can last a very short interval of time (below 1 second).</p><h2 id="useful-proof-of-work-upow" tabindex="-1">Useful Proof of Work (UPoW) <a class="header-anchor" href="#useful-proof-of-work-upow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Useful Proof of Work (UPoW)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A novel consensus mechanism that optimizes the energy expended in mining processes by directing computational power towards valuable, real-world tasks, such as training artificial intelligence models. Unlike traditional Proof of Work systems that &quot;waste&quot; energy by solving abstract puzzles, UPoW contributes to meaningful applications.</p><p>_</p><p>Please note that Qubic is still in development, and some aspects of the system are subject to change during the development and practical testing phase. No official whitepaper is available as of yet due to this ongoing development process.</p>',45),n=[i];function s(c,l,h,u,d,p){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(r,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
