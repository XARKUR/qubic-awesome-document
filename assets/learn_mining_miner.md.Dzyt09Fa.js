Instead of competing to verify and add transactions to a blockchain, Miners in Qubic work on specific computational problems or tasks assigned to them by Computors.

This interaction not only assists in verifying the integrity of the tasks but also aids in the overall processing and validation of actions within the network.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong>:</p><ul><li>Receive computational problems or tasks (represented by IDs) from Computors.</li><li>Upon successful problem-solving, relay solutions back to Computors, contributing to their score.</li><li>Integral to the Qubic&#39;s innovative system, where the emphasis is not solely on transaction verification but on overall task execution.</li></ul><p><strong>Potential</strong>: The Qubic network allows for a theoretically unlimited number of Miners, promoting widespread participation and ensuring robust computational power backing the system.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>It&#39;s crucial to note that only Computors receive weekly payments from the Qubic protocol. However, to maintain their position among the 676 Computors, they must accumulate sufficient solutions each epoch through their associated miners.
